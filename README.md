# Ping-Plong
A practice project I wanted to do on my own. I put in all the basic functionality I was hoping to put in, but I'd like to keep working on it to add new features:
 - Make it so the ball goes in a random direction at the start.
 - Give the ball velocity rather than vertical and horizontal speeds so it can move in any direction it likes rather than just diagonally.
 - Make it so the opponent computer player can predict where the ball will land and go there rather than just follow the balls vertical position.
 - Make it so there can be two players.
 - Make a simple GUI with buttons to pick two player or one player, as well as reply the game when you win or lose.
